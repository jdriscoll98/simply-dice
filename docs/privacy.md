# Privacy Policy

**Simply Dice** values your privacy. This app is designed to be simple, focused, and respectful of your personal data.

## Information We Collect

Simply Dice does **not** collect, store, or share any personally identifiable information.

The app operates fully on-device and does not require account creation, sign-in, or access to personal data.

## App Usage Data

Simply Dice may store basic preferences locally on your device, such as:

- Sound on/off
- Haptics on/off
- Shake-to-roll setting

These preferences are saved **only on your device** using local storage and are never transmitted off the device.

## Analytics

Simply Dice may use lightweight, privacy-conscious analytics to understand general app usage (such as feature interactions).  
No personal information, device identifiers, or sensitive data are collected or shared.

All analytics data, if present, is used solely to improve app stability and user experience.

## Third-Party Services

Simply Dice does not share personal data with third parties.  
Any system services used (such as haptics or motion detection) are handled directly by the operating system and remain on-device.

## Permissions

The app may request access to:

- **Motion sensors** (optional): Used only if the user enables shake-to-roll functionality.

Motion data is never stored, logged, or shared.

## Children’s Privacy

Simply Dice does not knowingly collect any data from children under the age of 13.

## Data Security

Because Simply Dice does not collect personal data, there is no personal information stored on external servers.

## Changes to This Policy

This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the app or its App Store listing.
